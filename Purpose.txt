Please write the code for an addon that works on top of gathermate2 with gathermate2data for wow classic version 1.14.3 API addon.
It should help increase the chance that I will find a treasure chest on the map.
It should enhance farming teasure chests, making it easier and more likely to successfully find treasure chests.
It should keep track of chests recently looted to adjust probability and tracking, thus always increasing odds of finding a treasure chest.  
This should be saved in permenant storage so that the data isn't lost on logout.
It should have proper slash command and interface options for all features.
Thee addon should use statistical analysis to determine the propbability that a chest is about to spawn.  
To enhance this, it should keep track of all players in the zone looting chests.
The addon should be humorous and entertaining when interfacing with the player since farming can be fairly mundane.
Please make sure thatit  works on top of gathermate2 with gathermate2data for wow classic version 1.14.3 API addon.
Please reconsider all requirements and make sure each requirement is met.

Please take into account the following addon works in my version and the Treasure Hunter addon should use the same API as the below addon.
