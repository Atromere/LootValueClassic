Loot Value
==========

Loot Value is a World of Warcraft addon that calculates the total value of items looted in a session and provides entertaining messages based on the value of the items. It considers both vendor prices and auction house prices (when available) to give you a better understanding of how much gold you've potentially earned during your adventures in Azeroth.

Features
--------

-   Calculates the total value of looted items
-   Displays the total value in a formatted gold, silver, and copper string
-   Provides entertaining messages based on the value range of the items
-   Considers item quality and uses auction house prices for common or better items
-   Fallback to vendor prices when auction house data is unavailable

Installation
------------

1.  Download the Loot Value addon.
2.  Extract the Loot Value folder to your World of Warcraft `Interface/AddOns` directory.
3.  Launch World of Warcraft or restart the game if it's already running.
4.  Ensure the addon is enabled in the "AddOns" menu on the character selection screen.

Usage
-----

Once the addon is installed and enabled, it will automatically start tracking the value of looted items. When you loot items, Loot Value will wait for 5 seconds before displaying the total value and an entertaining message. This message will be displayed in your chat window.

The addon will reset the total value and messages after each loot event, so you can keep track of the value of your loot as you play.
